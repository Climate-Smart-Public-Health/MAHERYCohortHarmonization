\title{Fix known misspellings and assign corrected household head names}
\usage{
fix_duplicate_misspelled_names(df, name_col = name, hh_col = hh_head_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing at least a name column, a household head name column,
and an \code{id} column used for conditional overrides.}

\item{name_col}{The unquoted name of the column in \code{df} containing the original (possibly misspelled) names.
Defaults to \code{name}.}

\item{hh_col}{The unquoted name of the column in \code{df} containing the household head names.
Defaults to \code{hh_head_name}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with standardized name values in \code{name_col}, and selected rows in \code{hh_col}
updated based on predefined \code{id} patterns. A new column is not created; the original columns are modified.
}
\description{
This function applies hand-curated corrections to a set of known misspelled names in a
data frame. It replaces values in the specified \code{name_col} with standardized spellings
using a hard-coded correction map. In addition, it conditionally renames household heads
in both the \code{name_col} and \code{hh_col} columns for specific known ID patterns.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Known misspellings are replaced based on a hardcoded correction map.
\item Specific IDs (e.g., those starting with \code{"A3dd6eda"} and \code{"48149ba9"}) are assigned known corrected names
directly in both \code{name_col} and \code{hh_col}.
}

df <- tibble::tibble(
  id = c("A3dd6eda123", "48149ba9111", "otherid"),
