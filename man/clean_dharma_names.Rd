\title{Clean participant names from DHARMA survey data}
\usage{
clean_dharma_names(df, name_col = L1_q1_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing a column named \code{L1_q1_name} with participant names.}
}
\value{
A data frame with an additional column \code{name_clean} containing the cleaned names.
}
\description{
This function standardizes participant names from the \code{L1_q1_name} column
by converting them to lowercase, replacing periods with spaces, and removing
extra whitespace.
}
\details{
The function replaces literal periods (\code{.}) in names with spaces using
regular expression syntax, then collapses any multiple spaces into one. This is useful
for ensuring consistent formatting in name-based joins or comparisons.
}
\examples{
df <- tibble::tibble(L1_q1_name = c("ALICE  Smith", " Bob Jones ", "c. miller"))
clean_dharma_names(df)
